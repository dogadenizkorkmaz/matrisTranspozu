Write a program in Java language to find the transpose of a matrix created with multidimensional arrays.

Transposing the matrix means swapping the same numbered rows and columns of the matrix. The matrix obtained as a result of this process is the transpose of the initial matrix. At this stage, the transpose of a kxn matrix becomes an nxk matrix. For example, let's have a matrix A. The transpose of this matrix A is denoted by A^T (A over T).

For example, the transpose of the 2x3 matrix A below is a 2x3 matrix A^T.
